      <h2>How to Keep Your Spine Healthy</h2>
      <p>
        Your spine is central to your body's structure and health. A well-cared-for spine supports mobility, balance, and nerve function. Here's a complete guide to protecting and enhancing spinal health — for life.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>1. Posture Awareness</h2>
      <p>
        Whether sitting, standing, or sleeping, good posture reduces strain on your spine. Sit with your back straight and shoulders back. Use ergonomic chairs. Sleep with your spine in a neutral position using a supportive mattress and pillow.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>2. Core Strengthening</h2>
      <p>
        Strong abdominal and back muscles support the spine. Engage in exercises like planks, bridges, and yoga to build a robust core.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>3. Lift Smart</h2>
      <p>
        Bend your knees, not your back, and keep objects close to your body. Avoid twisting while lifting. If it’s heavy, ask for help!
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>4. Regular Movement</h2>
      <p>
        Prolonged sitting can weaken spinal muscles and stress intervertebral discs. Stand up, stretch, and walk every 30–60 minutes. Movement nourishes spinal tissues through disc hydration and muscle circulation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>5. Maintain a Healthy Weight</h2>
      <p>
        Excess weight adds pressure to the spine, especially the lower back. A balanced diet and regular physical activity are essential for maintaining spinal integrity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>6. Hydration and Nutrition</h2>
      <p>
        Spinal discs rely on water for cushioning. Stay well hydrated, and consume calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, and omega-3s to support bone and disc health.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>7. Quit Smoking</h2>
      <p>
        Smoking restricts blood flow and reduces oxygen to spinal tissues. It accelerates disc degeneration and delays healing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>8. Choose the Right Footwear</h2>
      <p>
        Shoes with proper support align the spine and reduce stress. Avoid high heels and worn-out shoes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>9. Use Ergonomic Tools</h2>
      <p>
        Whether studying, working, or gaming, ensure your desk, screen, and chair support natural spinal alignment. Ergonomic setups minimize strain and reduce risk of chronic pain.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>10. Mind-Body Practices</h2>
      <p>
        Yoga, Pilates, tai chi, and meditation reduce muscle tension, improve awareness, and enhance flexibility — all contributing to spinal health.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>11. Prevent Falls</h2>
      <p>
        Especially important in older adults. Clear pathways, install handrails, and wear appropriate shoes. Falls can lead to vertebral fractures and long-term disability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>12. Get Professional Help</h2>
      <p>
        Don't ignore back pain. Consult a physician, physiotherapist, or spine specialist if symptoms persist. Early intervention prevents chronic conditions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Spine Health = Lifelong Wellness</h2>
      <p>
        A healthy spine supports a healthy life. Whether you're a student, athlete, or elder, your daily choices shape the future of your spine. Invest in movement, posture, and knowledge — because spine care is self-care.
