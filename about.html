      <h2>About The Spine Project</h2>
      <p>
        The Spine Project is a creative and educational initiative aimed at making spinal anatomy, pathology, and health accessible and engaging to everyone — from medical students to the general public.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to offer high-quality, clear, and accurate information about the spine’s function, its disorders, and how to maintain spinal wellness throughout life. We believe that empowering people with knowledge is the first step toward preventing spine-related health issues and improving quality of life.

      <h2>Meet the Creator</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Konstantinos Polyzoidis</strong>, a medical student at <strong>Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest</strong>. My passion for spine surgery and patient education drove me to create this platform — to share what I learn, support others in their learning journey, and spark curiosity around one of the most vital structures of the human body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through The Spine Project, I hope to contribute not only to the academic community but also to the well-being of anyone interested in spinal health.
