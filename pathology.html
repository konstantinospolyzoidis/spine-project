      <h2>Common Spine Pathologies</h2>
      <p>
        The spine is susceptible to a wide range of disorders that can affect mobility, sensation, and overall health. Understanding these pathologies helps in early detection, prevention, and management.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD)</h2>
      <p>
        A condition where intervertebral discs lose hydration and elasticity over time, leading to pain, reduced mobility, and in some cases, herniation or nerve compression. Symptoms often worsen with activity and improve with rest.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Herniated Disc</h2>
      <p>
        Occurs when the inner gel-like core of the disc protrudes through the outer layer. This can compress nearby nerves, leading to pain, numbness, or weakness — often in the lower limbs if it occurs in the lumbar spine.
      </p>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Scoliosis</h2>
      <p>
        A lateral curvature of the spine that can develop during adolescence or due to neuromuscular conditions. Mild cases may require observation, while severe curves might necessitate bracing or surgery.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Spinal Stenosis</h2>
      <p>
        Narrowing of the spinal canal, often from aging or arthritis, that puts pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. Symptoms include pain, tingling, and balance issues. Treatment includes physical therapy, medications, or surgery.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Ankylosing Spondylitis</h2>
      <p>
        A chronic inflammatory disease that causes fusion of the vertebrae, leading to a rigid spine. Early signs include back pain and stiffness, especially in the morning. Imaging and blood tests help confirm diagnosis.
      </p>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Osteoporosis and Compression Fractures</h2>
      <p>
        Reduced bone density increases the risk of fractures, particularly in the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Prevention includes calcium/vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise, and fall prevention.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Spinal Tumors and Infections</h2>
      <p>
        Though rare, tumors (benign or malignant) and infections such as osteomyelitis or discitis can severely compromise spinal integrity. Symptoms often include severe pain, fever, and neurological deficits.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Spine pathology is a vast and vital field, especially for medical students and healthcare providers. With rising life expectancy and sedentary lifestyles, spine conditions are increasingly relevant. Knowledge leads to prevention, earlier diagnosis, and better outcomes.
