      <h2>Spinal Physiology: Function Meets Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The physiology of the spine goes far beyond structural support. It plays a crucial role in movement, shock absorption, and most importantly, the transmission of neural signals. Understanding how it works gives us a better view of posture, reflexes, and balance.

      <h2>Nervous System and Reflex Arcs</h2>
      <p>
        The spine houses the spinal cord, the highway of communication between the brain and body. It’s involved in reflex arcs — rapid, involuntary responses like the knee-jerk reaction. These circuits bypass the brain to enable immediate reactions.
      </p>

      <h2>Disc Function and Hydration</h2>
      <p>
        Intervertebral discs act as shock absorbers. Made mostly of water and collagen, they compress during the day and rehydrate at night. Poor hydration and aging decrease their effectiveness, leading to decreased flexibility and height.
      </p>

      <h2>Movement Coordination</h2>
      <p>
        Spinal motion includes flexion, extension, lateral bending, and rotation. These motions are enabled by facet joints and intervertebral discs. Muscles and ligaments coordinate with neural signals to ensure smooth and stable movements.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2>Posture and Balance</h2>
      <p>
        Proper spinal alignment maintains balance and minimizes muscle strain. The spine's curvatures — cervical and lumbar lordosis, thoracic kyphosis — help in weight distribution. Dysfunction can lead to postural issues and compensatory pain.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Spinal physiology is about harmony — structure, nerves, muscles, and fluids working together. The better we understand its elegant systems, the more capable we are of preventing dysfunction and promoting long-term spinal health.
